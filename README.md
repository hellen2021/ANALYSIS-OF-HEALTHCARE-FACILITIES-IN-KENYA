# ANALYSIS-OF-HEALTHCARE-FACILITIES-IN-KENYA
### MORINGA FINAL PREP PROJECT
## Business Understanding
#### Overview
Universal Health Coverage, is one of the “Big Four” strategic pillars declared by the President of Kenya which will see major policy and administrative reforms in the medical sector, to ensure everyone has access to quality and affordable medical coverage by 2030 (Kenya Vision 2030).

One of the SDG goals under Good Health and WellBeing is to achieve universal health coverage, including financial risk protection, access to quality essential health-care services and access to safe, effective, quality and affordable essential medicines and vaccines for all.A good healthcare facility should meet requirements such as: adequate number of beds, doctors, nurses, presence of ICU units, number of services provided, the operation hours, affordability and accessibility to the public.

Primary care facilities in rural areas often suffer from shortages of staff, essential drugs, and basic medical equipment. Some patients choose not to seek care due to the distance that they would have to travel to reach the nearest health facility. Only 30% of the rural population has access to health facilities within 4km of their home, compared with 70% of the urban population (International Trade Administration, Kenya - Universal Healthcare Coverage).


#### Objective
To analyze the current health facilities in Kenya in order to recommend which counties the government should allocate more financial and human medical resources.
